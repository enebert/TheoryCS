We begin with a definition:

\begin{defn}
    Let $U$ be a universal function for the class of computable one varialbe functions. We can specify a numbering 
    of this class: The $n^{\text{th}}$ function is the section $U_n$. More generally, a nautral numbering 
    of an arbitrary set $\mathscr{F}$ is a total map $\nu:\N_0 \rightarrow \mathscr{F}$ which has range $\mathscr{F}$.
\end{defn}

\textbf{Goal: } Give an accurate formulation and proof for the statement: There exists an algorithm that assigns to a pair
of numbers of any two computable functions a number for their composition.

\textbf{Require: } The universal function doing the numbering to be computable.

\textbf{Need: } A G\"{o}del numbering.

We let $U$ be a binary computable universal function for the class of unary computable functions. It is called a G\"{o}del 
universal function if for any computable binary function $V$ there exists a total computable unary function
$s$ such that $V(m,x) = U(s(m),x) \hspace*{.15in} \forall m,x$. In other words the sections $V_m$ and $U_{s(m)}$ coincide.

\begin{thm}
    A G\"{o}del universal function exists.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let $T$ be a ternary computable function that is universal for all binary computable functions. One can construct such a 
    thing as follows:

    Fix an arbitrary computable numbering of pairs $\sigma:\N_0 \times \N_0 \rightarrow \N_0$ which is a 1-to-1 correspondence. We 
    assign $\sigma(u,v)$ to be the number of the pair $(u,v)$. Let $R$ be a universal computable function for the class 
    of all unary computable functions. We then define $T(n,u,v) = R(n, \sigma(u,v))$.

    \textbf{claim: } $T$ is universal for binary computable functions. 

    Let $F$ be an arbitrary binary computable function. Let $f(\sigma(u,v)) = F(u,v)$ which is a unary computable function.
    Since $R$ is universal, there exists an $n \in \N_0$ such that $R_n = f$ when applied to the input $x$. For 
    this $n$, we have that 
    \[
        T(n,u,v) = R(n,\sigma(u,v)) = f(\sigma(u,v)) = F(u,v).
    \]
    Since $T_n$ coincides with $F$ we've shown that $T$ is universal.

    We now endeavor to use $T$ to define a binary G\"{o}del universal function $U$. We set $U(\sigma(n,u),v) = T(n,u,v)$. 
    Any binary computable function $V$ occurs among the sections of $T$. Hence there is some $n$ such that $V(u,n) = T(n,u,v)$
    for every $u,v$. Then $V(u,v)=U(\sigma(n,u),v)$. We define $s(u) = \sigma(n,u)$. We conclude that the constructed universal 
    function is G\"{o}del.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    The numberings of computable functions that correspond to G\"{o}del universal functions are called G\"{o}del numberings.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    Let $U$ be a G\"{o}del universal function for the class of unary computable functions. Then there exists a 
    total function $c$ that assigns to numbers $p,q$ of two unary function a number $c(p,q)$ of their composition $U_{c(p,q)} = U_p \circ U_q$
    or $U_{c(p,q)}(x) = U(p,U_q(x))$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Consider a binary computable function $V$ defined by the equation $V(\sigma(p,q), x) = U(p,U(q,x))$. By the definition 
    of a G\"{o}del universal function, there exists a unary total computable function $s$ such that $V(m,x)=U(s(m),x) \hspace*{.15in} m,x$.
    In which case
    \[
        V(\sigma(p,q),x) = U(s(\sigma(p,q)),x).
    \]
    Hence $c(p,q) = s(\sigma(p,q))$ is the desired relation.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
    The converse is also true.
\end{rem}

\textbf{Q: } Does there exist a computable universal function that is not G\"{o}del? 

\textbf{A: } It turns out that the answer is yes.

\subsection*{Computable Sequences of Computable Functions}

Let $f_0, f_1, \ldots$ be a sequence of computable functions of one variable. We want to assign meaning to a sequence 
$i \mapsto f_i$ is computable. Here are two possible definitions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item This sequence is called computable if the binary function $F$ defined by $F(i,n) = f_i(n)$ is computable.
    \item This sequence is called computable if there exists a computable sequence of nautral numbers $c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots$ such that 
    such that $c_i$ is one of the numbers of the function $f_i$.
\end{enumerate}

The definition (b) depends on a numbering of computable functions. It turns out that these two definitions are 
equivalent if it is a G\"{o}del numbering.

\begin{thm}
    If the numbering is computable, then (b) $\Rightarrow$ (a). If the number is a G\"{o}del numbering, then (a) $\Rightarrow$ (b).
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    If $U$ is a computable universal function and the sequence $i \mapsto c_i$ is computable then 
    \[
        F(i,x) = f_i(x) = U_{c_i}(x)
    \]
    is computable as the composition of computable functions.

    Coversely, if a function $F$ is computable and $U$ is G\"{o}del universal function, then the coverter that 
    exists by definition of a $U$ being G\"{o}del, is the function that takes $i$ into one of the numbers of $f_i$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{G\"{o}del Universal Sets}

\begin{defn}
    An enumerable set $W \subset \N_0 \times \N_0$ is called a G\"{o}del universal enumerable set if for every enumerable set 
$V \subset \N_0 \times \N_0$ there exists a total computalbe function $s:\N_0 \rightarrow \N_0$ such that 
$(n,x) \in V$ if and only if $(s(n), x) \in W$ for every $n,x$.
\end{defn}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each set $U \subset \N_0 \times \N_0$ defines a numbering of a certain family of subsets in the following way: $n$ is a number 
of the $n^{\text{th}}$ section $U_n$.
    \item An enumerable subset of $\N_0 \times \N_0$ specifies a numbering of a certain family of enumerable subsets of $\N_0$.
    such numberings are computable.
    \item An enumerable subset $W \subset \N_0 \times \N_0$ is universal if and only if any enumerable subset $\N_0$ has a $W$-number, and $W$ is 
    a G\"{o}del set if and only if any computable numbering $V$ is computably reducible to the $W$ numbering in the sense that 
    $V_n = W_{s(n)}$ for some computable function $s$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{thm}
    A G\"{o}del universal enumerable set $W \subset \N_0 \times \N_0$ exists.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    This is a consequence of the following lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    The domain of a G\"{o}del universal function for the class of unary computable function is a G\"{o}del universal set 
    for the class of enumerable subsets of $\N_0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $U$ be a G\"{o}del universal function, and let $W$ be its domain. Consider an arbitrary enumerable set $V \subset \N_0 \times \N_0$ 
    and a computable function $G$ with domain $V$. Since $U$ is G\"{o}del there exists a total computable function 
    $s:\N_0 \rightarrow \N_0$ such that $G_n = U_{s(n)}$ and therefore their domains $V_n$ and $W_{s(n)}$ also coincide.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    Let $W \subset \N_0 \times \N_0$ be a G\"{o}del universal enumerable set. Then a number of the intersection of two enumerable 
    sets can be algorithmically computed from $W$-numbers of these sets: there exists a binary total computable function $s$ such that 
    $W_{s(m,n)} = W_m \cap W_n$.
\end{thm}
