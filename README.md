# Theory of CS 

**How did I get here?** 

As usual, it is not necessarily a short path to how I ended up studying a particular area. It has been a confluence of events that ended up merging together into this study. However, the short version is that I wanted to read JÃ¶rg Rothe's book *Complexity Theory and Cryptology* for quite some time. I bought a copy of the book and started reading it. I quickly realized that I did not have the background to understand the various hierarchies and the finer points of the complexity theory. 

I expect that the topics that are more related to computability and complexity theory will end up here. The material that is cryptographic in nature will end up in another repository.
