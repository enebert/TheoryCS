Reading: *Computable Functions* by Shen & Vereshchagin

* 5/23/25 - Computable functions, enumerable and decidable sets. Basic defintions covered.
* 5/25/25 - Universal functions and an enumerable set that is undecidable. Many of the proofs follow directly from the definitions. I'm still getting a sense of the threads that run through the concepts. I need to work through Post's construction of an enumerable undecidable set again.
* 5/29/25 - Typed the notes from chapter 3 on Godel numberings. This is a concept that I've run across before, but had little comprehension of what was happening beyond some intuitive sense. The authors work through the fact Godel universal functions exist and that it is possible to obtain a number for a composition of two functions from their numbers. I've begun Chapter 4 which delves into the properties of these Godel numberings. They set out to explain why it is that the set of numbers for the empty function is infinite and not decidable and in fact not even enumerable by Post's theorem.
* 5/30/25 - Not getting notes posted very quickly. I finished Chapter 4 up to Roger's theorem on isomorphisms of numberings. The book has been good for getting definitions and some of the basics, but having difficult getting a hold of the threads that run through the topic.
* 6/1/25 - Skipped ahead to Chapter 6 on $m$-reducibility. Frustrated with some of the vagueness in the book. The attempts at being colloquial and having flow are good, but the lack of exactness or understanding what the authors are thinking is frustrating. It's nice to encounter something familiar.
* 6/3/25 - Continued to work through facts about $m$-reducibility. The authors go into characterizing effective nonenumberability by a reduction. The proof is almost the same as that used to prove NP-Completeness. They end the section with the fact that Post introduced simple sets to find an enumberable undecidable set that is not $m$-complete.
