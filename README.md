Reading: *Computable Functions* by Shen & Vereshchagin

* 5/23/25 - Computable functions, enumerable and decidable sets. Basic defintions covered.
* 5/25/25 - Universal functions and an enumerable set that is undecidable. Many of the proofs follow directly from the definitions. I'm still getting a sense of the threads that run through the concepts. I need to work through Post's construction of an enumerable undecidable set again.
