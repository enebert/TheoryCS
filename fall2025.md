* 8/13/25 - Read Chapter 1. It motivates computability by giving basic definitions of total and partial functions. The motivation is then continued through the Halting problem and a short description of diagonalization, as it is a well-used tool in computability theory. The book uses a subset of Pascal for its While Programs. This isn't a distraction as it looks like a lot of algorithm presentations. However, it could be a distraction to the modern student if they looked at Pascal as an artifact of the past. It might be worthwhile to assign a set of homework problems that asked the student to translate the Pascal in the book into a language that students had experience with. 
* 8/15/25 - Wrote notes on the first chapter. They can be found here: [Chapter 1](./KMA%20Notes/Chapter%201.md) The notes contain some related material that isn't covered in the book.
* 8/16/25 - Read Chapter 2. The chapter describes while loop programs and gives some examples. The authors end the chapter with a restatement of Church's thesis for while loop programs. There are some exercises that are perhaps worth doing for someone trying to get an initial introduction to the area such as proving that the set of "goto" programs and the set of "flowchart" programs are equivalent.
