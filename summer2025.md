#### Reading: *Computable Functions* by Shen & Vereshchagin

* 5/23/25 - Computable functions, enumerable and decidable sets. Basic defintions covered.
* 5/25/25 - Universal functions and an enumerable set that is undecidable. Many of the proofs follow directly from the definitions. I'm still getting a sense of the threads that run through the concepts. I need to work through Post's construction of an enumerable undecidable set again.
* 5/29/25 - Typed the notes from chapter 3 on Godel numberings. This is a concept that I've run across before, but had little comprehension of what was happening beyond some intuitive sense. The authors work through the fact Godel universal functions exist and that it is possible to obtain a number for a composition of two functions from their numbers. I've begun Chapter 4 which delves into the properties of these Godel numberings. They set out to explain why it is that the set of numbers for the empty function is infinite and not decidable and in fact not even enumerable by Post's theorem.
* 5/30/25 - Not getting notes posted very quickly. I finished Chapter 4 up to Roger's theorem on isomorphisms of numberings. The book has been good for getting definitions and some of the basics, but having difficult getting a hold of the threads that run through the topic.
* 6/1/25 - Skipped ahead to Chapter 6 on $m$-reducibility. Frustrated with some of the vagueness in the book. The attempts at being colloquial and having flow are good, but the lack of exactness or understanding what the authors are thinking is frustrating. It's nice to encounter something familiar.
* 6/3/25 - Continued to work through facts about $m$-reducibility. The authors go into characterizing effective nonenumberability by a reduction. The proof is almost the same as that used to prove NP-Completeness. They end the section with the fact that Post introduced simple sets to find an enumberable undecidable set that is not $m$-complete.
* 6/6/25 - Worked through the chapter on oracles over the last couple of days. Basic facts are proven and a discussion of relativization. Continuing to be frustrated by the colloquial nature of the book.
* 6/8/25 - Worked through the basic definitions of $\Sigma_n$ and $\Pi_n$ of the arithmetical hierarchy.
* 6/9/25 - Worked through notes and got them typed up. Haven't proofread for errors.

I feel like I've gotten out of this book what I can. It's time to take my next steps toward understanding these ideas. 

#### Reading: *Computability: A Mathematical Sketchboook* by Douglas S. Bridges.

* 6/11/25 - Read Chapter 1 on Turing Machines
* 6/12/25 - Worked through chapter 1 carefully. The author gives a very careful definition of a Turing Machine. It is more involved than any other definition for a Turing Machine I've seen previously. The notation is mathematical in nature and he takes care to provide rigor. Some of the notation is highly symbolic. For instance $P_3^3(\delta(q,x)) = D$ for the direction the read / write head goes in the transition. I can see where it could be a lot to interpret for a simple concept. The rigor and the care makes for a very readable setup though engagement by the reader is required.
* 6/13/25 - Read Chapter 2 on Partial Functions and did some notes. He works through what it means for a partial function to be Turing computable. It was a little hard to decipher a couple of the theorems, but the proofs made it pretty clear what he was trying to accomplish. At the end of the chapter he works through the definitions for what it means to be primitive recursive and partial recursive. There are the ususal two examples with sum and mult. I hope that I can find a source that gives some kind of intuition around why these definitions are the way they are.
* 6/15/25 - Read Chapter 3 on recursively enumerable sets and did some notes. He ends the chapter with the $s-n-m$ theorem and universal Turing machines. The construction looks very much like G\"{o}del numberings. The details around the Turing Machines in this book are a lot of bookkeeping. I'm not sure how much those details really illuminate the computational aspects of what's going on. It is if nothing else rigorous and careful argumnet. I question if I'd use this book for a course as a part of the material is developed in the exercises. While that is not all bad, it can make it harder to put all of the strands together.
* 6/17/25 - Chapter 4 introduces the halting problem and a couple of other problems to go down the road of decidability. This chapter ends with a discussion of computable real numbers. Chapter 5 is on Rice's theorem and the Recursion theorem.
* I've decided to stop reading this book. I'm not getting out of it what I'd hoped and the perspective isn't really what I need right now. It's an interesting book but isn't working out for my context. Updted (6/21): Maybe I should ammend a "for now" to this. I can see what the author is trying to do now that the ideas are starting to coalesce in my brain. There is always a tension between formalism and actually understanding what's going on.

#### Reading: *Handbook of Mathematical Logic* ed. Jon Barwise 

* 6/18/25 - I read Enderton's article *Elements of Recursion Theory*. It brought together everything I've been reading over the past month. The threads of what I've been trying to grasp are finally starting to coalesce. He starts with the idea of what it means to be computable and works his way into recursive and decidable. There is an intuitive notion of a Turing Machine given which leads to the defintion of a recursive partial function on $\mathbb{N}_0$ and then to what it means to be a decidable set. Enderton then describes recursive enumerable (re) and how this relates to being able to verify instead of decide. The rest of the article delves 
  into degrees of Turing machines and analytic sets and the arithmetic hierarchy. I will definitely be coming back to this as I delve into these things further. I feel like there are some of these concepts that are finally getting ingrained through revisiting them in this article.
* 6/19/25 - I read Martin Davis' article "Unsolvable Problems". He begins by reviewing the necessary information from Enderton's article and then the Halting problem. Each of the problems that he reviews come down to a variation of the halting problem in some sense. The general approach to showing that something is unsolvable is to show that a certain set property isn't recursive. He then goes into semi-Thue systems and Thue-systems. For those that have seen context-free grammars this is going to seem familiar and CFGs come up later in the expostion. The article finishes with the group word problem and Hilbert's 10th problem. These are problems
  I've long been interested in, but have not looked into before. This article was a nice introduction to both of those topics and the ideas behind them. 


* 6/20/25 - Took a detour to chapter 15 of *Understanding Computation* by Rosenberg and Heath. The chapter is titled *Nondeterminism and Unbounded Search*. They go through the idea of moving through a tree of moves as the computation progresses and that with nondeterminism many branches of this tree may be explored in parallel. They make a point of noticing the difference between exploring one of these trees through a breath first methodology and allowing some branch to be explored much deeper than the others are currently. They end the chapter discussing homomorphisms of languages and the operation that the homomorphism preserves is concatenation. If a NTM accepts a word $w$ from a language then there should be an NTM that accepts the image of $w$ under that homomorphism. The book definitely has a different approach, but I think it did help me gain some intuition.

* 6/21/25 - Starting to dive into the article *Decidable Theories* by Rabin. In the first section, he has introduced the idea of a theory or a problem being decidable. I'm having to go back and remind myself (learn) some of the notation from first order logic.
* 6/24/25 - I have finished reading the article by Rabin. While I was able to get a sense of the three methods discussed:

1. Elimination of Quantifiers
2. Using Model Theory
3. The Use of Semantic Interpretations 

I do not have the background to understand more than a very high level notion of what he's doing. It's interesting that there is a relation to proving the decidability of some of these theories through the use of finite automata and apparently transfinite induction makes an appearance as well. I was glad to read the article to get exposure but actual understanding would require a deeper dive into models and other areas of mathematical logic.

* 7/3/25 - Read the article *Degrees of Undecidability: A Survey of Results* by Stephen G. Simpson. The article draws some inspiration from ring theory as the author uses the term ideal in the set of degrees. He mentions that this can be viewed as the kernel of a homomorphism and later describes how to mod out by an ideal $I$ in order to obtain a set of equivalence classes. The structure of the set of degrees is quite a complicated and complex landscape. There is also a bit of discussion about the High / Low hierarchy as well as the jump operator. These are things I've seen mentioned before but only had a vague sense of. At the end of the article, the author discusses the degrees that lie between $\mathbb{0}$ and $\mathbb{0'}$, which by itself is a complex thing. I now understand what one of the introductory books was trying to describe. Much of this was beyond my understanding and I would need more background to understand what's happening at a deeper level. However, I did get a good deal out of it by better understanding how these kinds of results fit into a larger theory and why people are interested in them.
* 7/4/25 - Read about half of this article: [Degrees of Unsolvability](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~fejer/articles/History_of_Degrees.pdf)
It is very good to get context to some of these things that I've seen refered to before. Much like Simpson's article, I only have a broad handle on the material, but it's still quite useful.
* 7/6/25 - I finished reading *Degrees of Unsolvability* article linked above. It was good to get a survey of the area and become aware of the results in the area. The material at the end of the paper on *Definability & Automorphisms* was difficult to follow with my lack of background. It seems like many areas of mathematics go through something akin to Lachlan's *Monster paper* describing how the splitting and density theorems could not be combined. A problem has been though about enough, over time, that failure has lead to adjustments and further failure put on repeat. Once enough adjustments have been made, a complex construction has come out of it. One of the other nice things about such histories being published is the bibliography that comes with them. Places to dig and explore in the future.

#### Reading: *Computability Theory: An Introduction to Recursion Theory* by Herbert B. Enderton

* 6/24/25 - Read Chapter 1, Section 1 which is an overview of decidability, semidecidability and then goes into universal Turing machines and the fact that such a machine can simulate all machines. The chapter ends with a discussion of the Chruch-Turing thesis.
* 6/28/25 - Chapter 1, Section 1 notes. Section 2 on Turing machines. The description of Turing machines is a short overview that culminates in a small discussion of the Busy Beaver contest.
* 6/29/25 - Finished the rest of Chapter 1. Enderton has short discussions of other notions of computability. He first goes through the definitions of primitive recursive functions. He then adds the search operator and gets to general recursive functions. There is a short discussion at the end of the chapter that describes why and how this terminology came about. Enderton then gets into loop and while languages followed up by register machines. The next topic is Church's formulation of the $\lambda$-Calculus. He then takes a very short detour into a connection with logic and $\Sigma_1$. The chapter ends with revisiting the Church-Turning thesis and the miracle that all of these notions of computability are all the same.
* 6/30/25 - Read the section on Chapter 2 about primitive recursive functions. This is the explanation that I have been searching for about this topic! He lays out the definition of being primitive recursive and then goes through a dozen or so examples. There are details for you to fill in as you read, but it made sense to me this time. His use of trees to explain how to decompose a function into its constiuent parts is what clicked for me. He ends the section by seeing that divisibility is a primitive recursive relation. I have a few notes left to do for this section, but am very enthused that I finally have gained some real understanding around this topic.
* 7/2/25 - Read the section on bounded search. It is the best description of the $\mu$-operator that I'm aware of. He finishes the section with some number theory and encoding schemes.
* 7/3/25 - Finished reading chapter 2. He finishes up with the notion of a general recursive partial function that uses the class of primitive recursive functions and then adds in the ability to do unbounded search with the $\mu$-operator. He discusses how one cannot diagonalize there way out of this class and that Chruch's Thesis implies that this class contains all of the effectively computable partial functions. 
* 7/4/25 - Read the beginning of chapter 3 where Register machines are discussed and it is shown that register machines can computer all general recursive partial functions.
* 7/5/25 - Read the major part of chapter 3 which produces a universal program which is equivalent to the construction of a universal Turing machine. He revisits material from chapter 1, that was covered informally, such as the noncomputability of a diagonal function and the halting problem. He approaches the Normal Form Theorem by parameterizing time and looking at snapshots of the program at time $t$. It's now clearer to me what Bridges was doing in chapter 3 of his book. I can see the advantages of using register machines from a pedagogical point-of-view. You only have a handful of instruction which can easily be encoded. We are not concerned with time or space so the encoding doesn't need to be efficient. I can see how this approach would give students something to get their hands on that is tangible versus using Turing Machines as abstract notions. No matter which notion is used, it is a bit tedious if not painful to produce a program or an algorithm, but it gives a tangible link to the abstraction. I don't know if Enderton's book is that much better written or if it is simply an easier read at this point because I've struggled through these concepts through previous readings. Whatever the case, things are starting to coalesce. 
* 7/7/25 - Read chapter 4 which is a survey on results around recursively enumerable sets. He begins by surveying the results fromt he previous chapter about the halting problem and diagonalization. There are a number of different techniques discussed from the use of a universal function to enumerate all computable partial functions to finding a set of indices that cannot be recursively enumerable. He ends the section with Rice's theorem and the $s-n-m$ theorem. I again feel like I have gained context for things that were being done in Shen. Enderton uses a good bit of colloquial language but it is never so vague as that I don't understand where he's coming from. There is a quick discussion of mapping reducibility and its use in showing that a set is not r.e. Overall I continue to feel like the material is continuing to congeal for me.
* 7/22/25 - Reach chapter 5 section 1. Review of the arithmetic hierarchy. Once again got computable and r.e. confused. Still a worthwhile refresher once I got this sorted out. Questions met with curiosity keeps ideas and concepts getting embedded a little deeper. He works thorugh the definition of a $\Sigma_1$ set and a $\Pi_1$ set. The usual facts about being closed under union and intersection are gone over. The definition of $\Delta_1$ is then discussed and that these are the decidable sets. He then goes through the use of "vacuous" quantifiers to show that a $\Sigma_1$ or $\Pi_1$ set is $\Delta_2$. He ends the section by showing that each step of the hierarchy adds something new. There's also a small bit about mapping reductions at the end of the section.
